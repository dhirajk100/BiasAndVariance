BiasAndVariance
Bias and Variance | Bias Variance Trade-off | Over-fitting and Under-fitting in Machine Learning
Bias is the error introduced by very simplistic assumptions in a model. This leads to under-fitting.
Variance is the error introduced when a model is too sensitive to fluctuations in the training data. This leads to Over-fitting in Machine Learning
